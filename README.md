# Rocket League Bot

Python-based Rocket League bot built using the RLBot framework with a rule-based decision system for automated gameplay.

## Features
• Rule-based decision engine for gameplay actions  
• Boost collection and resource management logic  
• Goal positioning and defensive rotation behavior  
• Ball alignment detection and shot execution  
• Vector-based steering and movement  
• Unit tests for decision logic and helper methods  

## Technologies
Python, RLBot Framework, Object-Oriented Programming, Unit Testing, Vector Mathematics  

## Overview
This project was developed as part of CS5001 coursework and focuses on building a game-playing bot capable of making real-time decisions based on in-game conditions. The bot evaluates boost levels, positioning, and ball alignment to determine actions such as collecting boost, rotating to goal, repositioning, or charging toward the ball.
